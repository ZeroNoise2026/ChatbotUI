Claim-level faithfulness judge.

Why claim-level and not a 1-10 score
------------------------------------
A holistic "rate this summary 1-10" is the cheapest thing to build and the
least useful thing to own. It is unstable across runs, it cannot tell you
*which* sentence was wrong, and it cannot distinguish "the context did not
mention this" from "the context says the opposite". So this judge does two
stages:

    stage 1  summary  -> atomic, self-contained claims
    stage 2  claims + context -> per-claim verdict + verbatim evidence span

    faithfulness = supported / total_claims

Verdicts are three-valued on purpose:

    supported     the context states this, or directly entails it
    unsupported   the context is SILENT on this. Not necessarily false.
    contradicted  the context states something incompatible. Always fatal.

`unsupported` and `contradicted` are different failures with different fixes
(retrieval gap vs. the model overriding its evidence), so collapsing them
would throw away the most actionable signal in the whole suite.

The judge is told to reason ONLY from the supplied context. A claim that is
true in the real world but absent from the context is `unsupported`, not
`supported`. That is the definition of faithfulness, and it is also why this
suite measures faithfulness rather than correctness — see README, FX3.

Judges misbehave too
--------------------
A judge that returns unparseable JSON must not silently count as a pass OR a
fail. It retries once; if it still fails, `JudgeError` is raised and the
runner records the run as `error` in its own column.

Verdict definitions - read carefully, they are not interchangeable:

- "supported"    CONTEXT explicitly states the claim, or the claim follows

- "unsupported"  CONTEXT is SILENT on the claim. Use this even when you
                 personally believe the claim is true. Absence of evidence
                 is "unsupported", never "supported".
- "contradicted" CONTEXT states something logically incompatible with the
                 claim - a different number for the same quantity, a
                 different date for the same event, an opposite direction.

CRITICAL: judge ONLY from CONTEXT. You have no outside knowledge. A claim
that is factually true in the real world but absent from CONTEXT is
"unsupported". Do not fill gaps from memory.

"evidence" must be copied verbatim from CONTEXT (max 200 chars). Use an empty
string only when the verdict is "unsupported". "evidence_source" is the
bracketed section label the evidence came from, or "NONE".
